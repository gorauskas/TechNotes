<!-- title: Virtual Box Fails to Start Virtual Machine -->

I recently moved to a new house and during the move something really peculiar
occured with my computer: It seems that the UEFI chip reset to the factory
defaults. The 2 visible outcomes of this was that the computer clock was reset
back to `2009-01-01 00:00:00` and that the Hardware Virtualization on the CPU
was turned off. The latter manifested itself as an error when I tried to run
virtual machines with Virtual Box. This was the error generated by Virtual Box:

![VBox Error](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2826/9028489579_329cc402f6_o.png)

To fix these errors I had to first set the correct system date and timezone
offset and then I had to boot into the UEFI setup utility and enable hardware
virtualization for the Intel i7 CPU. This setting is going to be slightly
different on every motherboard, but after I enabled it VBox started to run the
VMs as usual.
