> Take advantage of the opportunity to get valuable face time with your boss. I'd

> "I was under a lot of pressure, but things seem to be flowing well now. I've got
> a firm grip on the situation and am seeing some good output. It may take awhile
> before I achieve completion, but it's important to take one's time in order to
